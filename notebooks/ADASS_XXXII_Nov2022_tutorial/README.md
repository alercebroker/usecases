# ADASS XXXII ALeRCE tutorial

See detailed explanation in https://alerce.science/alerce-adass-tutorial-2022/.

## List of Notebooks:

[ALeRCE client notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alercebroker/usecases/blob/master/notebooks/ADASS_XXXII_Nov2022_tutorial/ALeRCE_Client_starter.ipynb)
The ALeRCE client is a library to interact programmatically with the ALeRCE API. It allows you to interact more easily with the API via a Python library. You can query the light curve, probabilities, or features associated with different objects via simple commands in Python.

[ALeRCE SN Starter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alercebroker/usecases/blob/master/notebooks/ALeRCE_SN_Starter.ipynb)
This notebook shows how to use the ALeRCE client to query and visualize SN related data. This includes object light curves, features and classification probabilities.

[ALeRCE AGN Starter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alercebroker/usecases/blob/master/notebooks/ADASS_XXXII_Nov2022_tutorial/ALeRCE_AGN_starter.ipynb)
The notebook is focused on Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) mostly using the results from the light curve classifier. After a brief introduction, we will use the ALeRCE client to retrieve the light curve for one particular AGN, and then for a sample of sources. Then, we will learn how to use the ALeRCE database to retrieve large samples of AGN.

[ALeRCE ML notebook (bonus)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alercebroker/usecases/blob/master/notebooks/ADASS_XXXII_Nov2022_tutorial/ALeRCE_ML_Stamp_Classifier.ipynb)
In this notebook you will explore the data used in the Stamp classifier and an explanation of the model is given. The link to the notebook is the following:
