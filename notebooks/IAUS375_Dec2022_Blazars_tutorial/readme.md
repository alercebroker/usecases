#  IAUS 375: : The Multimessenger Chakra of Blazar Jets - ALeRCE Tutorial

This tutorial will be focused on science that be done with ALeRCE to study Blazars. After an introduction to ALeRCE and its general services, 
we will use the following Jupyter Notebook:

[ALeRCE Blazar Starter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alercebroker/usecases/blob/master/notebooks/IAUS375_Dec2022_Blazars_tutorial/ALeRCE_Blazar_starter.ipynb)
The notebook is focused on Blazars mostly using the results from the light curve classifier. After a brief introduction, we will use the ALeRCE client to retrieve the light curve for one particular Blazar, and then for a sample of sources. Then, we will learn how to use the ALeRCE database to retrieve large samples of Blazars and AGN, and to compare their properties.
