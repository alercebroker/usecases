    "This notebook introduces the Rubin alert stream data that are stored in the ALeRCE database, showing all tables that are relevant for LSST. We use the pyvo package to execute Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) queries to the ALeRCE Table Access Protocol (TAP) service, and display output tables as pandas dataframes.\n",

    "*It is highly recommended that you try this notebook in Google Colab using the following [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alercebroker/usecases/blob/master/notebooks/LSST/ALeRCE_LSST_Tables.ipynb).* This will avoid you from having to sort out library installation problems and focus on the contents of the tutorial. You can try installing the dependencies later in your own system."

For the pandas package, we suggest to read input files together the pyarrow functionality when reading input files (by adding ```dtype_backend='pyarrow'``` as parameter), and convert pandas columns from ```int64``` type to ```Int64``` (or ```int64[pyarrow]```) when needed."

Caution is advised when working with tables obtained by mixed means (e.g. using ADQL outputs together with RSP catalogs, or with the ALeRCE python client outputs).

    "The ALeRCE pipeline computes probabilities for different classifiers. At this time, we classify LSST objects using the ALeRCE stamp classifier, which is a deep learning classifier based on each object's first alert image cutouts (manuscript in preparation; see [Carrasco-Davis et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162..231C/abstract) for a similar version using the ZTF public alert stream). This classifier taxonomy includes five classes, and is used to pre-select transient candidates (e.g. supernovae, tidal disruption events) early after their first light."
